            <p class="shoo"> I am a beginner programmer whose dream is to be able to create fun games that people can enjoy. I got into programming as a hobby. As I grew older, I became more interested in game development. I started watching videos about game design and I even watched basic tutorials just to get started on programming. After helping a friend out with his mods for a game, I decided I wanted to be able to create my own games as a career. As a programmer, the programming language that I am most familiar with at the moment is c#. I do have a small amount of experience with c++ and html, but I am still hoping to improve my skills on more languages if possible. </p>
